You can contact us at any time to find out what information about your activities is stored on our servers. You can also contact us to remove them. In some cases, we can refuse to remove it and we can retain data for limited periods when we need to keep them for legal business or legislation purposes.

If you ask us to remove data or content related to your account, we will try to make sure that we protect you against accidental or malicious deletion. For this reason, we may request additional verification of your identity (for example, via email or phone), and it may take some time from the moment you request deletion until the time it is performed.

We will share the data with third parties if, in good faith, we believe that access to information, use, storage or disclosure is reasonably necessary:

in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes or executive requirements of state authorities;
in order to apply the applicable terms of use of the service, including investigating potential violations of these conditions;
in order to discover, prevent or in some other way solve problems of fraud and security or technical problems;
in order to protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, our users or the public as prescribed or permitted by law.
The Website may at any time change the privacy policy without notice.

Any changes to the Privacy Policy will be highlighted at the very beginning of this page.
