A perfect place for shaking it up, whether with your friends or while following the vibe of amazing performers or following the moves of the ever-smiling dancers up on the stage. If only two words could be used to describe this stage, it would be "infectious energy". It's virtually impossible to visit Latino and not get your groove on. Even festival-goers passing the stage start moving to the catchy beats!
